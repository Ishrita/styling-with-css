	<h1> ARTISH </h1>
	<hr>

<p> This image is named as flower girl. The purple flower all around the girls face gives an essence of beauty. That hide the eyes of girl but the lips and rest of the face is left. This type of picture can be usually seen on instagrams as an click idea.The thing which I particularly like about this artpiece is the highlights of the nail and lips.</p>

<p>This more sort of cute but wild cat dangerous in real life and could eat you raw.Be safe and run as fast as you can when you see it.The thing which I like most in this artpiece is the eyes- the green eyes of the cat or leopard and also the black patches all over the body.</p>

<p>This is inspired by the marvel film - VENOM. If you would see this you would remember even the scene. If you didn't see this movie you should see this movie as soon as possible, you would love it.
